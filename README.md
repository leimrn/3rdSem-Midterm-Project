# Java Payroll System

> **CCOBJPGL | Object-Oriented Programming | Week 3 Lab**

***

## Project Overview

An interactive TUI Java Payroll application designed to calculate and exhibit employee earnings based on specific employment categories. The system highlights core OOP strategies, including data hiding through encapsulation, organized class hierarchies, custom constructors, and formal accessors/mutators.

## Employee Types

| Type | Rate Basis | Leave Benefits | Cut-off |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Regular | Monthly | ✔ Yes | 1st–15th / 16th–30th |
| Probationary | Monthly | ✔ Yes | 1st–15th / 16th–30th |
| Contractual | Monthly | ✘ No | 1st–15th / 16th–30th |
| Part-Time | Hourly | ✘ No (no work, no pay) | Weekly |

***

## Payroll Computation

### Gross Pay
- Basic salary (monthly rate or hourly × hours worked)
- Overtime pay (holiday rate research required)

### Deductions
- Withholding Tax (per BIR tax table)
- SSS contribution (per SSS table)
- PhilHealth contribution
- Pag-IBIG contribution
- Loans (if any)
- Undertime / Absence deductions

### Net Pay
```
Net Pay = Gross Pay − Total Deductions
```

***

## Work Schedule

- **Work days:** Monday–Friday
- **Work hours:** 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM (8 hrs/day, 1 hr break)
- **Overtime:** Hours beyond 5:00 PM
- **Undertime:** Early departure / late arrival
- **Absences:** Full-day no-shows (leave credits applied for Regular/Probationary)

***

## OOP Structure Requirements

- [ ] At least 3 user-defined classes
- [ ] All attributes declared as `private`
- [ ] Constructors implemented for all classes
- [ ] Getters and setters used throughout
- [ ] `Main.java` controls program flow only — no business logic
- [ ] Objects or `ArrayList` used (no static variables only)

## Sprint Plan

| Day | Focus | Assignee |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Day 1 | Repo setup, Jira board, task assignments | Project Manager |
| Day 2 | `Employee` base class + 4 subclasses | Dev |
| Day 3 | Payroll computation (gross pay + deductions) | Dev |
| Day 4 | TUI menu system + `PayslipRenderer` | Dev |
| Day 5 | Integration, testing, PR review, demo | All |

***

## How to Run

## Prerequesites
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Terminal / Command Prompt

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [link to repo]
cd [repo name]
```

```bash
# Compile
javac -d out src/**/*.java

# Run
java -cp out Main
```

> **Note:** ANSI color codes require a terminal that supports them.
> On Windows, use **Windows Terminal** or **Git Bash**.
> On Linux/macOS, any standard terminal works.
